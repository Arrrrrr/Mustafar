# Publishing = FUN

How much fun? Just keep scrolling to find out.

## DTD (death-star.dtd)

A DTD structures your XML. A DTD tells your XML file which element tags it is allowed to use. Information architects develop DTDs to control the structure of content.

## XML (death-star.xml)

A file written in element tags. Its structure is controlled by the DTD. Authors write content in XML files.

## XSL (death-star.xsl)

A file that converts XML into another file format, such as HTML or PDF. Information architects develop XSL files, and then run XML and XSL files together in an XSL processor (such as Saxon or Xalan) to produce output. 

## ANT (ant-death-star.xml)

An ant script is a tool information architects use to run XML and XSL files together in an XSL processor (other tools include the Command Line Interface or oXygen XML Editor). This Ant script was created to be run in Eclipse, and to run the files death-star.xml and death-star.xsl though the Saxon XSL processor to output death-star.html.

## HTML (death-star.html)

Output result of the publishing process.

## CSS (death-star.css)

Information architects develop CSS to style HTML files.
